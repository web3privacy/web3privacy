# Decentralised identity

**Practical approach**: "I am..." (example "I am an accredited investor") - use this during research or a brainstorm thinking around "proving certain attribute of an identity" without revealing whole picture. Another example: "_I am a Starcraft 2 Grandmaster league player" - attribute, "but I don't want others to know that I'm a Serral_"

# NFT
| Use case | Example |
| :---         |     :---:      |
| Secret NFTs are non-fungible tokens that—unlike their ERC-721 cousins—have additional privacy features like private metadata and ownership. This protects collectors by shielding their identity and empowers creators by enabling them to control who can access their work, how, and when. | [Secret](https://scrt.network/about/secret-nfts)| 
| Creators can leverage Secret NFT’s private metadata to create experiences not possible with non-private NFTs, like embedding secret links to high-quality images and creating game items with hidden abilities. | [Secret](https://scrt.network/about/secret-nfts)| 
| Private galleries: can restrict viewership to maintain rarity & exclusivity. Art owners can keep their ownership status private | [Secret](https://scrt.network/about/secret-nfts)| 
| Artists & collectors can maintain financial privacy by decoupling wallet balances from NFT art & collectibles | [Secret](https://scrt.network/about/secret-nfts)|
