# web3privacy
**Web3privacy** - a research project aimed to discover, highlight &amp; analyze privacy-preservation services and startups within the Web3 space.

![alt text](https://github.com/Msiusko/web3privacy/blob/main/Logo.png?raw=true)

**Note!** It's important to highlight projects at the different stages of development (from ideation to ecosystem scaling). This means some privacy-centric solutions could go via fundraising points within their roadmap. This creates gaps between mature & forthcoming privacy solutions (especially when 9 out of 10 startups fail). That's why it's essential to let all privacy-preserved ideas be heard within the Web3 space. And give them an equal opportunity to succeed.
