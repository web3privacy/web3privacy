**Privacy scoring options to consider**

**Note**: _final scoring model shouldn't be too complex to execute._

_Sketches what could be put inside privacy-solutions scoring model_ (note: think of these as questions to experts for workshop on scoring ideation).

**Open-source transparency**
- **GitHub repos**: # of commits, # stars, date of repo creation.

**Third party validation**
- **Security audits**: yes, no; type of audit; ammount of audits.

**Community validation**
- Existing bugs
- White hackers assesment (like Secret Network TEE bug)
- Negative Discord, Twitter, other public feedback (product & founder-centric)

**Team**
- Market validation
- GitHub contribution
- Track record (incl. red flag projects)

**Financials**
- Investments
- TVL (like Aztec's L2)
- Donation-based
- Public treasury

**Liveliness**
- How active is GitHub activity 
- How active is community
- Is there a public product traction?

**Product-readiness**
- State of product-readiness
- MVP-readiness
- Protocol (test-net/main-net)
- dApp (release timing, third party validation like AppStore/Play Store)
- network-reliability (the state of privacy in Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche etc)

**Cross-checked data leakage**
- Complementing privacy stack data leakage (example: phone + dApp; wallet + RPC etc)
- Third party data leakage (from the hackers to state agents (think of Iran or North Korea govs))
