# A new scheme of scoring model

| Criteria | Detail | Validity level | Score |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------ |
| Referrable source code | Available git repo and doc, and the functionality presented in the doc is referred in the git repo | No repo or doc (0), not referrable repo with doc (1), referrable repo with doc (2) | 50-&Delta;% |
| Audit | Open to audit and up-to-date third-party audit | Not open to audit(0), open to audit without up-to-date third-party audit (1), up-to-date third-party audit (2) | 25% |
| Anonymity | Registration and connection does not depend on user's real identity | Real identity required (0), linkable identity required (1), full anonymous (2) | 25% |
| Decentralization | Decentralized storage and administration | Not fully decentralized (0), fully decentralized (1) | &Delta;% |

## Explanation of the criteria

**Referrable source code**
- For non-techies
	- Check the existence of public git repository and doc
	- Check the existence of code files in the git repository
	- List the focusing privacy-preserving points in the doc
	- Check the reference of code file names with the focusing points
- For beginner techies:
	- Check the existence of public git repository and doc
	- Check the existence of code files in the git repository and view the code
	- List the privacy-preserving measures in the doc and seek the reference in the source code

**Audit**
- For non-techies and beginner techies
	- Check the existence of an application or other type of implementation of the project and its availability towards third-party audits
	- Check the audit history of the project

**Anonymity**
- For non-techies:
	- Register an account or use personal account of other on-chain project to connect to the network or launch the app
	- List the information required for the account
- For beginner techies:
	- The task as non-techies
	- Also with the presence of IP-obfuscation techniques (Tor, etc.) in the project

**Decentralization**
-	For non-techies and beginner techies:
	- Check the power distribution of management in the doc (if pointed);
	- Check the information about server location (if exists);
