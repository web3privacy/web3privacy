# Scoring model 1.2: validity track

_Validity track covers GitHub, Product-readiness, Team, Docs, Audit._

**Note**: quick assessment helps to decrease privacy dark patterns from obscure language to test-net claiming it has a "state of art privacy".

## Sandbox
**Extended**
| Project | GitHub | Product-readiness | Team | Docs | Audit | Contributors | Licenses | Support | Score |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Test project** | available & active GitHub / not (25%) | Live or 🚧 (exclusion criteria) | public team / not (25%) | available & not marketing docs / not (25%) | available & up to date third-party audit / not (25%) | external contributors outside of the team members | What licenses are in use | Some form of support available? (telegram, discord, forum) | from 0 to 100% |
| **score** | 12.5% | 12.5% | 12.5% | 12.5% | 12.5% | 12.5% | 12.5% | 12.5% | 100% |

**GitHub**
* Is it in stable release, 1.0 and not an alpha or untested code?
* Are there many PRs and Issues pending?
* Are there external contributors outside of the team members?

**Docs**
- read the documentation: is it comprehensive?

**Team**
* Check if there are known contributors (reputation 101)
* Check commits at GitHub
* How many community contributors beyond core team?
* How many technical specialists in the team?
* How mature are core contributors (previous projects, GitHub commits)?

**Third-party audit**
- Were bugs fixed?
- How centralized is the protocol governance?
- How centralized are product updates?
