Privacy is a top priority in the era of web, an essential human right. Web3privacy now would create a scoring mechanism (both professional & communal) to provide unbiased tools for assessing projects & helping users through education, raising our collective privacy literacy.

# Platform features

- **Scoring mechanism**
We'll reserach and develop a unique privacy scoring mechanism & create a tool with the help of privacy experts from the Ethereum Foundation, NYM and others while building on the experiene of active members from both solar and lunarpunk communities. The goal is to collectively raise the maturity of privacy products & services accross all layers of the technology stack. 

In parallel to the top-down scorecard method, we'll develop and implement a bottom-up community scoring platform too (think of Metacritic exters + users scorings). We believe that at the end of the day it's the users who have to become the real watchdogs of the industry, signaling about flaws and shortcomings of solutions (like Secret Network's recent critical bug).

Critical approach: professional scoring would be a joint R&D with the key web3 people from protocol architects to security specialists. This will help to create an unbiased take from scratch & enabling a transparent working process, accessible to everyone via a forum.

- **Privacy services database** 
The biggest privacy services database with the latest R&D tracks from [Privacy & Scaling explorations](http://appliedzkp.org) to [Chainsafe](http://chainsafe.io) proposals.
Highly helpful to everyone exploring & researching cutting-edge of the privacy stack (including builders & hackathon-enablers).

Access it here: https://github.com/Msiusko/web3privacy

**Privacy guides**.
Extensive privacy guides covering broad audiences from Iranian human rights activists to Ukrainian people living on occupied territories.

_Practical guides will match_

- existing privacy solutions from Sismo to NYM with privacy-personas (NGOs, anon donors, activists).
- non-tech people with accessible privacy solutions (with the focus on human rights & sensitive audiences)
- tech-people with advanced privacy solutions & practices

# How the future looks for Web3privacy now
![alt text](https://github.com/Msiusko/web3privacy/blob/main/Web3privacynowplatform/Staticobjects/Screenshot%202023-01-27%20at%2011.48.53.png?raw=true)

- **Privacy hub**. Becoming the leading online privacy repository, empowering anyone with access the latest insights, analysis and data from across the industry.
- **Privacy education**. Extensive wiki about privacy technology and user-focused service literacy. Guides created by community experts, evaluated by users.
- **Privacy advocacy**. We don't only promote privacy, but more broadly: we'll be working on normalising the concept of privacy as an inalienable human right. We'll catalyse the shift of the meta-narrative and perception within the entire society: investors, decision makers, developers, web3 & web2 actors and the general public too. 

# So what's next
1. Grant: for the initial project research & MVP delivery (scoring mechanism principles, MPV scope, team structures, basic project management tools subs).
2. Dev scope: stack + scope of work + dev team
3. MVP: definition + timing + KPIs
4. GitHub transparency: all repos, all roadmaps, public team members, scoring principles etc.

# KPIs
**MVP-centric**
- **Research track**: scoring model v 1.0 + expert validation
- **Product track**: basic functionality mapping (incl. UX/UI research), copywriting, basic brand design system, scoring model applicability to all existing privacy-preserving web3 projects (300+ projects).
- **Tech delivery track**: v 1.0 website (minimum functionality for testing), QA, bug fixing
- **Community accessibility & awareness**: socials registration, community development, forum setup.

**Note**: _governance model - in consideration_

**Beta**
The next product release will include 
- **community feddback **(voting for the projects, writing user-feedback etc) 
- **leaderboard** (categories) to motivate companies compete with each other for better privacy preservation.
- **incidents dabatse**: [Press Freedom Tracker](https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/) example

# Timing
**Time-to-MVP > 3 months**

**Breakdown**: 
- **Scoring modeling**: 3 weeks+
- **Product management** (UX, copy, scoring aplicability, design): 1 month
- **Web-development + testing**: 1 month

**In a nutshell**: 
- a research paper: scoring model > sketch is available [here](https://github.com/Msiusko/web3privacy/blob/main/Web3privacynowplatform/Scoringmodel.md)
- a code repo at GitHub
- working website + public scoring model.
