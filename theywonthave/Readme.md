_**Prioritize and select your most privacy-centric use-case ideas!**_

**What is this for?**
The tool is to help you brainstorm & select applicable ideas for privacy use-cases. The What if... they won't have my data matrix helps you categorize ideas according to:

_Datasets_: what private data is involved in the cases 

_Threat actors_: what kind of threat actors (governments, corporates, hackers) are involved in data abuse

_Available data abuses_: how these actors use your data

_Unavailable data impact_: how data usage or approach changes when there's no data available

_Privacy benefits_: how systems, relations, economies change after getting back control to your data

**Step-by-step guide**

**Step 1**
Download this PDF and print it on an A2 sheet of paper. You can also draw the graph on a flipchart if you can’t print.

**Step 2**
Grab all your post-its with ideas on them from a previous ideation exercise. Plot the ideas into the wow-now-wow matrix.

**Step 3**
Take 3 voting-dots for each person (or use a marker), and vote 3 favorite ideas. After the voting session, select the 3 ideas which received the most votes.

**Step 4**
Step back and analyze the privacy benefits. In an ideal scenario, your “unavailable data impact” and “benefits” fields should highlight the most feasible ideas for now – and the most impactful for the future.
