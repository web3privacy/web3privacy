Part of the Ethereum Privacy Ecosystem [report](https://docs.web3privacy.info/research/ethereum-privacy-ecosystem/)

# Privacy-centric use-cases DB built within Ethereum hackathons

_Purpose_: 

1. Collect existing hackathon demos & ideas in one place. 
2. Analyze what challenges devs are solving within the hackathons (innovative use-cases, R&D).
3. Create a user-friendly space for ecosystem actors to collaborate with each other: support existing demos, expand use-cases, collaborate with each other, be inspired.
